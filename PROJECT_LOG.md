February 24th, 2026, just added the build a course agent chat. It has improvements that need to be made, because right now you can chat with the agent and then upload a PDF. It does recognize the different chapters or sections, and then it gives the title, chapter number, and objectives of reading that chapter, and also gives a description of the chapter. What it doesn't give is the ability to then further chat with the agent and build the course in parallel. I would also like the UI to have the chat and the build course to be vertical with each other. Right now it's all one long scroll, so you can see them side by side. What's not great is that there isn't an edit course tool, so this agent just gives you one output, and then you can either accept it or completely regenerate it. Completely regenerating isn't great, because this thing is 80% of the way there. I just want to make a couple of tweaks. Also, one bug I face is that we weren't able to; it didn't detect the last chapter of the book, which isn't that important of a chapter, but I'm just not sure why it did. I'd rather have it detected and have me remove it, or at least give me the ability to tell it to add it. Right now it's not able to do that, so I'm curious how to make that possible.

Okay, still February 24th, 2026, about 9:00 PM. I'm using the Course Builder agent after doing the updates from the above paragraph, and there are some interesting problems. It seems to be asking a lot of questions, and also its responses are giant paragraphs. Some of the information is really interesting, but the formatting is off; it's just giant paragraphs, and they look overwhelming. I think maybe it could be more concise, also perhaps breaking it up into new lines? It's going to ask so much. It should really feel like a text message exchange, so maybe new lines would be nice? It can use markdown, and we should either render markdown or not show it? I think that's a good starting point. Also, I just hit the generating plan button, and it says it's generating the plan. I do know it's working, but once we're in that phase, I think a detail is that we should move the chat over at that point and then show a placeholder for where the plan will show up. Then show that template for the different sections with the placeholder blocks (the ones that shine to show that this is where data will populate), and it looks good for loading. My final point is that we overall need to update this UI. It just looks like it was built by engineers. It doesn't have any design taste, so I think it could use a whole design system overhaul. I need to scroll the page to see the bottom of the chat, so I think there's an overflow on the course creation page once we enter the plan edit mode. I think when you look at the details on this page. I'd like to have Claude Code use the Chrome extension and actually poke around the UI itself to see these details.
